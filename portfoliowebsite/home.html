It has a powerful, muscular body with a large head and paws, a long tail and orange fur with black, mostly vertical stripes. It is traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies, though some recognise only two subspecies, mainland Asian tigers and the island tigers of the Sunda Islands. "

Historically, lion "types" were divided into the African lion and the Asiatic lion.4 However, genetic studies have more recently established that lions living in India are more closely related to the lions living in Central and West Africa than to those living in Southern or Eastern Africa. It is thought that the two subspecies overlap in Ethiopia, Sudan and South Sudan.
